### A simple Node.js weather app.  
In progress.  
I haven't added weather checking functionality yet. :)



#### Set up the weather app:  
After you've downloaded the repository you need to create an `apikeys.js` file in the `apikeys` folder. The content of the `apikeys.js` file should look like this:  

```
const darkSkyKey = "YOUR_DARKSKY_API_KEY";

module.exports.darkSkyKey = darkSkyKey;
```  

#### Using the weather app  

Example input:  
`node app -a "gothenburg central station"`  

Example output (success):  
```
Gothenburg Central Station, Drottningtorget, 411 03 GÃ¶teborg, Sweden
It's currently 33.45.
It feels like 22.36.
```
